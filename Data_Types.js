In Kotlin, there are various types of data available to represent different kinds of information. Here are some commonly used data types in Kotlin:

1.Numbers:

Byte: Represents a signed 8-bit integer (-128 to 127).
Short: Represents a signed 16-bit integer (-32,768 to 32,767).
Int: Represents a signed 32-bit integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647).
Long: Represents a signed 64-bit integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807).
Float: Represents a 32-bit floating-point number.
Double: Represents a 64-bit floating-point number.

Numbers:

val byteNumber: Byte = 10
val shortNumber: Short = 100
val intNumber: Int = 1000
val longNumber: Long = 100000L
val floatNumber: Float = 3.14f
val doubleNumber: Double = 3.14159

2.Characters and Strings:

Char: Represents a single Unicode character.
String: Represents a sequence of characters.

Characters and Strings:

val charValue: Char = 'A'
val stringValue: String = "Hello, Kotlin!"

3.Booleans:

Boolean: Represents a value of either true or false.

Booleans:

val isTrue: Boolean = true
val isFalse: Boolean = false


4.Arrays:

Array: Represents a fixed-size array of elements.

Arrays:

val numbers: Array<Int> = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val names: Array<String> = arrayOf("John", "Jane", 
                                   
                                   
5.Collections:

    List: Represents an ordered collection of elements.
    Set: Represents an unordered collection of unique elements.
    Map: Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
                                   
collections:

val list: List<Int> = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val set: Set<String> = setOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
val map: Map<String, Int> = mapOf("one" to 1, "two" 
                                  
                                  
                                  
6.Other types:

Any: Represents the root of the Kotlin class hierarchy. All classes inherit from Any.
Unit: Represents the absence of a value. Similar to void in other languages.
Nothing: Represents a value that never exists. Used for functions that never return.

                                  
7.Other types:

val anyValue: Any = 42
val unitValue: Unit = Unit
val nothingValue: Nothing = throw Exception(
                                  
                                  
 8.Nullables
                                  
Kotlin also provides nullable versions of most data types by appending a ? to the type name.
For example, String? represents a nullable string that can either hold a string value or be null.
val nullableString: String? = null
val nullableInt: Int? = 10


Additionally, you can create your own custom data types using classes, interfaces, and enums.

These are some of the basic data types available in Kotlin. Depending on your needs,
                                  you can choose the appropriate data type to represent and manipulate your data effectively.

    In Kotlin, data types are used to classify data and determine how the compiler should treat it. The most fundamental data type in Kotlin is the Primitive data type, and all others are reference types like array and string. Kotlin treats everything as an object, which means that you can call member functions and properties on any variable geeksforgeeks.org, tutorialspoint.com.

Here are the main data types in Kotlin:

Number Data Types: Kotlin has six built-in number types: Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float, and Double programiz.com. These types are used to define variables that hold numeric values. They can be divided into two groups: Integer types (Byte, Short, Int, Long) for whole numbers and Floating-point types (Float, Double) for numbers with a fractional part tutorialspoint.com.
Boolean Data Type: Boolean data type represents one bit of information, either true or false. You can perform disjunction (||) or conjunction (&&) operations on boolean types geeksforgeeks.org.
Character Data Type: Kotlin character data type is used to store a single character and is represented by the Char keyword. A Char value must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or '1' tutorialspoint.com.
String Data Type: The String data type is used to store a sequence of characters. String values must be surrounded by double quotes (" ") or triple quotes (""" """). Kotlin has two types of strings: Escaped String (declared within double quotes " ") and Raw String (declared within triple quotes """ """) tutorialspoint.com.
Array Data Type: Arrays in Kotlin are represented by the Array class. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value tutorialspoint.com, programiz.com.
Kotlin does not support direct conversion of one numeric data type to another. To convert a numeric data type to another type, Kotlin provides a set of functions like toLong(), toInt(), toFloat(), etc. tutorialspoint.com.

Here's an example of how to use different data types in Kotlin:

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
   val intVar: Int = 42
   val doubleVar: Double = 3.14
   val boolVar: Boolean = true
   val charVar: Char = 'A'
   val stringVar: String = "Hello, Kotlin!"
   val intArrayVar: IntArray = intArrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

   println("Int Value: $intVar")
   println("Double Value: $doubleVar")
   println("Boolean Value: $boolVar")
   println("Char Value: $charVar")
   println("String Value: $stringVar")
   println("IntArray Value: ${intArrayVar.joinToString()}")
}
Output:

Int Value: 42
Double Value: 3.14
Boolean Value: true
Char Value: A
String Value: Hello, Kotlin!
IntArray Value: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
In summary, Kotlin has several data types to represent different kinds of data, such as numbers, booleans, characters, strings, and arrays. These data types allow you to work with various types of data in your programs and perform operations specific to those types.
