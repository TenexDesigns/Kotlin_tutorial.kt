Lambda functions, also known as lambda expressions or anonymous functions, are a concise way to define functions in Kotlin. They are used to create small, inline functions that can be passed as arguments to other functions or stored in variables. Lambdas are particularly useful for implementing functional programming concepts like higher-order functions.

The basic syntax of a lambda function in Kotlin is as follows:

kotlin
Copy code
val lambdaName: (parameters) -> returnType = { arguments -> functionBody }
Here's an example of a lambda function that adds two numbers:

kotlin
Copy code
val add: (Int, Int) -> Int = { a, b -> a + b }
In the code above, we declare a lambda function named add. It takes two Int parameters and returns an Int. The function body adds the two parameters a and b and returns their sum.

Lambda functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or used as return values. Here are a few examples to illustrate their usage:

Assigning a lambda to a variable:

kotlin
Copy code
val multiply: (Int, Int) -> Int = { a, b -> a * b }
Passing a lambda as an argument:

kotlin
Copy code
fun applyOperation(a: Int, b: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -> Int): Int {
    return operation(a, b)
}

val result = applyOperation(5, 3,{ x, y -> x + y })
Using a lambda as a return value:

kotlin
Copy code
fun createMultiplier(factor: Int): (Int) -> Int {
    return { number -> number * factor }
}

val double = createMultiplier(2)
val multipliedValue = double(5) // Returns 10
In the example above, the applyOperation function takes two Int arguments and a lambda function operation as the third argument. It applies the lambda function to the two arguments and returns the result.

The createMultiplier function returns a lambda function that multiplies a given number by the specified factor. We assign the returned lambda to the variable double, and then we can call double as a function to multiply a number by 2.

Lambda functions provide a concise and expressive way to define functions inline without the need for named function declarations. They allow for more flexible and powerful functional programming patterns in Kotlin.

Lambda functions in Kotlin are anonymous functions that can be used as expressions without declaring them. They are defined within curly braces {} and can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to higher-order functions programiz.com.

Here's a basic example of a lambda function in Kotlin:

val sum = { a: Int, b: Int -> a + b }

fun main() {
    val result = sum(3, 5)
    println("Sum: $result")
}
In this example, sum is a lambda function that takes two integer parameters a and b and returns their sum. The variable result stores the result of the lambda function when called with arguments 3 and 5.

Lambda functions are often used in higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results. For example:

fun applyOperation(a: Int, b: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -> Int): Int {
    return operation(a, b)
}

fun main() {
    val multiply = { a: Int, b: Int -> a * b }
    val result = applyOperation(3, 5, multiply)
    println("Multiplication: $result")
}
In this example, applyOperation is a higher-order function that takes two integers a and b, and a lambda function operation. The applyOperation function calls the operation lambda function with the given arguments a and b and returns the result. In the main function, we define a multiply lambda function and pass it as an argument to the applyOperation function.
