In Kotlin, inheritance allows you to define a new class based on an existing class. The existing class is known as the superclass or base class, and the new class is known as the subclass or derived class. The subclass inherits all the properties and functions of the superclass, and can also add new properties and functions or override the properties and functions inherited from the superclass geeksforgeeks.org.

In Kotlin, all classes are final by default, which means they cannot be inherited. To make a class inheritable, you must use the open keyword in front of the base class. The derived class inherits the base class using the : operator in the class header (after the derived class name or constructor) javatpoint.com.

Here's an example of inheritance in Kotlin:

open class Animal(val name: String) {
    fun makeSound() {
        println("The animal makes a sound")
    }
}

class Dog(name: String) : Animal(name) {
    fun bark() {
        println("The dog barks")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val myDog = Dog("Buddy")
    myDog.makeSound() // Calls the inherited function from Animal
    myDog.bark() // Calls the bark function from Dog
}
In this example, there is an Animal class marked as open to allow inheritance. The Dog class inherits the Animal class and adds its own bark() function. The myDog object, which is an instance of the Dog class, can call both the makeSound() function from the Animal superclass and the bark() function from the Dog subclass.

Inheritance enables code reusability, improved abstraction, and polymorphism, but it may also introduce complexity and tight coupling between the superclass and the subclass geeksforgeeks.org.

In Kotlin, you can create class hierarchies and establish inheritance relationships between classes. Inheritance allows you to define a base class (also known as a superclass or parent class) and derive new classes (also known as subclasses or child classes) from it. The subclasses inherit the properties and methods of the base class, allowing for code reuse and specialization.

To create a subclass that inherits from a base class, you use the : symbol followed by the name of the base class in the subclass declaration. Here's an example:

kotlin
Copy code
open class Animal {
    open fun makeSound() {
        println("The animal makes a sound.")
    }
}

class Dog : Animal() {
    override fun makeSound() {
        println("The dog barks.")
    }
}

class Cat : Animal() {
    override fun makeSound() {
        println("The cat meows.")
    }
}
In the code above, we have a base class called Animal with a method makeSound(). The makeSound() method is marked with the open keyword, which indicates that it can be overridden by subclasses.

We then define two subclasses, Dog and Cat, which inherit from the Animal class using the : symbol. The subclasses override the makeSound() method to provide their own implementation.

To create instances of the subclasses and invoke their methods, we can do the following:

kotlin
Copy code
fun main() {
    val dog = Dog()
    dog.makeSound()  // Output: The dog barks.

    val cat = Cat()
    cat.makeSound()  // Output: The cat meows.
}
In the main() function, we create instances of the Dog and Cat classes using their respective constructors. We can then call the makeSound() method on these objects, and each subclass invokes its own implementation of the method.

Inheritance in Kotlin allows you to create class hierarchies and leverage the properties and methods defined in the base class. It promotes code reuse, modularity, and supports polymorphism, where objects of different subclasses can be treated interchangeably.
