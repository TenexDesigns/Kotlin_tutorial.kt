In Kotlin, anonymous classes are created using object expressions, which allow you to declare and instantiate anonymous classes in
  a single expression at the point of use baeldung.com. These anonymous objects are lightweight and typically used for one-time use cases.

Kotlin does not have a direct equivalent of Javas anonymous inner classes, but you can achieve similar behavior using object expressions. 
You can create an object expression of an interface, for example, by implementing its abstract methods tutorialspoint.com:

interface MyInterface {
    fun call(context: String)
}

fun main() {
    val anonymousObject = object : MyInterface {
        override fun call(context: String) {
            println("This is an implementation of $context")
        }
    }
    anonymousObject.call("MyInterface")
}
In this example, we create an anonymous object that implements the MyInterface interface by providing an implementation for its call method. 
This anonymous object can be used directly without declaring a new subclass.

You can also create anonymous objects from an abstract class or even from scratch, without extending any existing class or implementing any 
interface baeldung.com:

abstract class MyAbstractClass(val value: Int) {
    abstract fun displayValue()
}

fun main() {
    val anonymousObject = object : MyAbstractClass(42) {
        override fun displayValue() {
            println("Value is $value")
        }
    }
    anonymousObject.displayValue()
}
In this example, we create an anonymous object that extends the MyAbstractClass abstract class by providing an implementation for its displayValue method and passing a value to the constructor.

  In object-oriented programming, an anonymous class is a class that is defined on the fly, without giving it a name. 
  It is typically used when you need to create a one-time implementation of an interface or extend a class without explicitly creating a separate named class.

Anonymous classes are particularly useful when you need to provide an implementation for a single-use case, such as event handlers, listeners, 
or callback functions.

In Kotlin, you can create anonymous classes using object expressions. An object expression allows you to create an instance of a class 
and define its implementation in-place, without explicitly declaring a named class.

Heres an example of creating an anonymous class using an object expression in Kotlin:


interface MyInterface {
    fun doSomething()
}

fun main() {
    val myObj = object : MyInterface {
        override fun doSomething() {
            println("Doing something in anonymous class")
        }
    }

    myObj.doSomething()
}

In the code above, we define an interface MyInterface with a single function doSomething(). 
Inside the main() function, we create an instance of an anonymous class that implements MyInterface. 
  We override the doSomething() function with the desired implementation.

We can then use the myObj instance to call the overridden doSomething() function.

Anonymous classes provide a way to define implementations on the fly without the need to explicitly create a separate named class. 
They are handy when you have a specific use case that requires a temporary implementation for an interface or a class.

Its important to note that anonymous classes cannot be reused or referenced elsewhere in the code. If you need to reuse the same implementation 
in multiple places or want to reference the class directly, it is recommended to create a separate named class instead.
