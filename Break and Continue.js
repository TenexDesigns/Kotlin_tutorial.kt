Yes, Kotlin does have the break and continue keywords, which are used to control the flow of execution within loops and conditional statements. Here's how they work:

break:
The break keyword is used to terminate the nearest enclosing loop or when used with a label, it can break out of a specific labeled loop. When encountered, the break statement immediately exits the loop, and the control flow continues to the next statement after the loop. Here's an example:
kotlin
Copy code
for (i in 1..5) {
    if (i == 3) {
        break
    }
    println(i)
}
Output:

Copy code
1
2
In the above example, when i becomes 3, the break statement is executed, and the loop terminates.

You can also use labels with the break keyword to break out of an outer loop from within an inner loop. Here's an example:

kotlin
Copy code
outerLoop@ for (i in 1..3) {
    for (j in 1..3) {
        if (j == 2) {
            break@outerLoop
        }
        println("i: $i, j: $j")
    }
}
Output:

yaml
Copy code
i: 1, j: 1
In this example, the break@outerLoop statement is used to break out of the outer loop labeled as outerLoop when j becomes 2.

continue:
The continue keyword is used to skip the remaining statements within a loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. When encountered, the continue statement skips the rest of the code within the loop for that particular iteration and moves to the next iteration. Here's an example:
kotlin
Copy code
for (i in 1..5) {
    if (i == 3) {
        continue
    }
    println(i)
}
Output:

Copy code
1
2
4
5
In the above example, when i is 3, the continue statement is executed, and the loop skips printing that value. It proceeds to the next iteration, skipping the rest of the loop body.

Both break and continue can be used with or without labels, depending on whether you want to affect the nearest enclosing loop or a specific labeled loop. They are useful for controlling the flow of execution and handling certain conditions within loops.
