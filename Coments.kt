In Kotlin, you can add comments to your code to make it more readable and provide additional information. There are two types of comments in Kotlin: single-line comments and multi-line comments.

Single-line comments:
Use // to start a single-line comment. Everything after // on the same line is considered a comment and will be ignored by the compiler. For example:

kotlin
Copy code
// This is a single-line comment
val age = 25 // This comment explains the purpose of the variable
Multi-line comments:
Use /* to start a multi-line comment and */ to end it. Everything between /* and */ will be treated as a comment. This type of comment is useful for adding longer explanations or disabling a block of code. For example:

kotlin
Copy code
/* This is a multi-line comment
   that spans multiple lines.
   It can be used to provide detailed
   explanations or disable blocks of code.
*/

/* This is a comment block
   that temporarily disables code execution
val age = 25
*/
Comments are not executed by the compiler, so they don't affect the behavior or performance of your program. They are solely for human readers and developers to understand the code better. It's good practice to add comments to your code to document its purpose, logic, and any important information that might be useful for future developers or yourself.
