In Kotlin, the while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The syntax of the while loop in Kotlin is as follows:

kotlin
Copy code
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of while loops in Kotlin:

kotlin
Copy code
var count = 0
while (count < 5) {
    println("Count: $count")
    count++
}
Output:

makefile
Copy code
Count: 0
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
In the above example, the while loop continues executing the code block as long as the count variable is less than 5. With each iteration, the value of count is incremented by 1 using the count++ statement.

It's important to ensure that the condition inside the while loop eventually becomes false, otherwise, the loop will continue indefinitely, resulting in an infinite loop. To prevent infinite loops, you can modify the condition or include an appropriate termination condition within the loop block.

Additionally, Kotlin provides a variation of the while loop called the do-while loop. The do-while loop first executes the block of code and then checks the condition. This ensures that the code block executes at least once, regardless of the condition. Here's an example:

kotlin
Copy code
var i = 0
do {
    println("Value of i: $i")
    i++
} while (i < 5)
Output:

less
Copy code
Value of i: 0
Value of i: 1
Value of i: 2
Value of i: 3
Value of i: 4
In the do-while loop, the code block executes first, and then the condition is checked. If the condition is true, the loop continues executing.
