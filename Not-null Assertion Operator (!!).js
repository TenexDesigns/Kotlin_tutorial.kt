The not-null assertion operator !! in Kotlin is used to assert that a nullable expression is not null.
It tells the compiler to treat the expression as non-null, even though its type is nullable.
When you use the !! operator on a nullable variable or expression,
  you are telling the compiler that you are certain that the value is not null at that particular point in the code.
  If the value happens to be null, a NullPointerException will be thrown at runtime marketsplash.com.

Heres an example to illustrate the usage of the not-null assertion operator:

val nullableString: String? = "Hello"
val nonNullString: String = nullableString!! // Using !! to assert non-nullability
println(nonNullString.length) // The compiler treats nonNullString as non-null
However, its crucial to exercise caution when using the not-null assertion operator.
If the value on which !! is applied is actually null at runtime, a NullPointerException will be thrown. 
It bypasses Kotlins null safety checks, and the responsibility of ensuring non-nullability lies entirely on the developer 
marketsplash.com.

Its generally recommended to use safer techniques like safe calls (?.) or null checks (!= null) to handle nullable 
values and ensure code reliability. The not-null assertion operator (!!) should be used sparingly 
and only when you are certain that a nullable expression will not be null at a specific point in the code.

Heres an example that demonstrates the potential risk of using the not-null assertion operator when the value is null:

val nullableString: String? = null
val nonNullString: String = nullableString!! // Throws NullPointerException
println(nonNullString.length)

In this example, a NullPointerException will be thrown when trying to assert that nullableString is not null,
  as it is actually null at runtime baeldung.com.
