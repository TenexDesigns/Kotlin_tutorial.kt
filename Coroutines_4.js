Kotlin Coroutines provide a way to write asynchronous, non-blocking code in a more readable and expressive manner. They allow you to create suspending functions that can be paused and resumed without blocking the current thread. Here is a simple example that demonstrates how to use coroutines in Kotlin:

First, add the necessary dependencies in your build.gradle file:
   implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.5.2'
   implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android:1.5.2'
Define a suspending function:
   import kotlinx.coroutines.delay

   suspend fun fetchUser(userId: Int): String {
       delay(1000) // Simulate a network request
       return "User $userId"
   }
Use a coroutine builder to launch the coroutine:
   import kotlinx.coroutines.GlobalScope
   import kotlinx.coroutines.launch

   fun main() {
       GlobalScope.launch {
           val user = fetchUser(1)
           println(user)
       }
   }
In this example, we define a suspending function fetchUser that simulates a network request by using the delay function. We then use the launch coroutine builder from the GlobalScope to start the coroutine and fetch the user.

Keep in mind that using GlobalScope is generally not recommended in real-world applications, as it may lead to memory leaks. Instead, use a properly scoped coroutine scope tied to the lifecycle of your application components.
